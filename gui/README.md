# gui

This Project is the realisation of a gui to better use the auto analyser tool which is fo now only usable via CMD.


## HOW To use it

When lunched you can create a new analysis with the button new where you select a file to analyse.

then you can build your chaine with the blocks available on you right and run it with the run button.


For now it will only run every step but in the futur we can imagine that there will the possibility to run just a portion and see the result.


## TODO

- in the future availableModules will be generated automatically based on available python modules
- Make a functional tree interface for the build process
